# Program: Min Heap and Max Heap Construction
 # a) Data Structures: **Array (`arr[]`)** - → Holds heap elements  
- **Binary Heap Concept** → Parent-child relationship through indices  

---

 ## b) Functions and Purpose

1. `heapify(int arr[], int n, int i, int isMin)` → Preserves heap property (max or min).

2. `buildHeap(int arr[], int n, int isMin)` → Constructs the heap from the array.

---

 ## c) main()
- Sets up an array.  
Min Heap is built.  
Max Heap is built.  
Both heaps are printed.

 ## d) Example Findings

Heap Minimum: 1 5 3 10 4 Maximum 10 5 3 4 1 is the heap.
