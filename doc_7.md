# Program: Dijkstra Shortest Path # a) Data Structures: **Adjacency Matrix (`graph[V][V]`)** - → Holds edge weights  
**Array (`dist[V]`)** - Stores the shortest distances  
**Array (`visited[V]`)** → Monitors processed vertices  

---

 ## Function and Purpose

1. `minDist(int dist[], int visited[])` → Identifies the vertex with the smallest distance.

2. `dijkstra(int src)` → Determines the shortest routes from the source.

---

 ## c) main()
Dijkstra is called from vertex 0.

 ## d) Example Findings

Distances: 0 to 0  
1 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 7
